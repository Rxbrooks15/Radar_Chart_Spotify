# Radar_Chart_Spotify

D3.js radar/spider plot documenting 6 aspects of music (danceability, liveness, energy,etc) . There are hover funtionalities and highlighting features. The main characteristic of this data is explaining as much of the data in one instance as possible. This is where the hover features come handy in order to classify the data.


Note: Page load time for chart calculating attributes based on artist names takes longer than usual to load the page 

Features::
Hover/Highlighting: Users can hover over area charts to get an idea of the genre, year or artist of a song
Dropbox: Users can explore other graphs based on variables of interest 
Searchbox: Usersa are able to type artist names, years, or genres which will highlight the area chart for the corresponding category 
Checkbox: Used to select specific variables of interest on the legend 
Reset button: Resets page

Delving into the realm of data visualization within the domain of modern music genres, I embarked on a project leveraging Spotify's dataset sourced from Kaggle. I was looking to craft a visualization that would encapsulate intricate narratives embedded within the data.

My endeavor culminated in the creation of a Radar or Spider plot, strategically designed to unravel nuanced insights from the dataset. However, the journey to manifest this visualization was riddled with challenges, particularly in implementing interactive featuresâ€”an aspect I deemed paramount for user engagement.

 Departing from my customary approach of simplistic geometries, I ventured into uncharted territories, pushing the boundaries of complexity. The Radar chart, with its intricate axes and angular subtleties, posed a formidable challenge. In pursuit of a comprehensive narrative, I delved into various musical attributes such as danceability, energy, and liveness, among others.

The visualization unfolded as smoothed area charts, meticulously plotted across six radial values, each representing a distinct attribute, set against a circular backdrop. Thismethodical approach aimed to elucidate underlying patterns and disparities across different genres.

My curiosity drove me to discern any discernible similarities or disparities among genres, and the outcome surpassed expectations. The highlight feature, in particular, accentuated salient aspects of the chart, elevating its visual impact. Challenges I faced include getting the searchbox to work, highlighting data based on the checkbox and ordering the dropbox as on one of the charts, it was impossible to select categories due to the lag.
